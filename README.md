## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Language-Agnostic**: Supports code in any programming language.
- ⚙️ **OpenVINO Optimization**: Runs efficiently across hardware architectures (CPU/GPU/NPU).
- 💬 **Chat Interface (Experimental)**: Early interaction model based on conversational prompts.
- 📄 **Code Understanding**: Extracts logic and generates function/class documentation automatically.
- ☁️ **Coming Soon**: Auto-processing upon file upload, no manual input required.
