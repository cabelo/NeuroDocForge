**NeuroDocForge** is an AI-powered tool that automatically documents source code written in *any* programming language. It leverages state-of-the-art LLMs optimized with **OpenVINO™**, enabling fast, efficient inference on **CPU**, **GPU**, and **NPU** — even on local machines.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Language-Agnostic**: Supports code in any programming language.
- ⚙️ **OpenVINO Optimization**: Runs efficiently across hardware architectures (CPU/GPU/NPU).
- 💬 **Chat Interface (Experimental)**: Early interaction model based on conversational prompts.
- 📄 **Code Understanding**: Extracts logic and generates function/class documentation automatically.
- ☁️ **Coming Soon**: Auto-processing upon file upload, no manual input required.
